	<h4> October 18, 2022 </h4>

<p> College students who are registered to vote are more likely to end up casting a ballot, a study from Tufts University suggests.</p>

<p>In 2020, 80 percent of college students nationwide who were registered followed through on Election Day, an 11 percent increase from 2016. During the same period, voter turnout rates among eligible students at private colleges and universities spiked 14-17 percent. These trends were consistent and even higher at Manhattan College in the Bronx, where 59.6 of eligible students voted — an 18 percent increase in  turnout compared to 2016. This success is partly owed to institutional “get out the vote” initiatives that were led by a voter engagement committee that shared its messages on social media and organized voter registration tabling events on campus. A partnership with the women’s basketball coach also yielded a 100 percent voter registration rate among student-athletes on that team.</p>

<p>To ensure New York City college students vote in the upcoming midterm election on November 8, re-energizing 2020 voters is essential, as is ramping up efforts to register newly eligible students. Then, be sure they cast their vote on Election Day. College students, voting is an effective way for policymakers to address the issues you care about. Don’t wait to register — you must apply by October 14 to participate in the midterms.</p>
<p>Follow this step-by-step guide to have your voice heard in the November midterm elections:</p>
